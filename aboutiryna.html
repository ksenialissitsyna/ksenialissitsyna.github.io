                <p>I am a Marriage and Family therapist registered intern (#81771) practicing under supervision of Don Hadlock, licensed MFT (license #15316) at Process Therapy Institute in Campbell.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have graduated from Institute of Transpersonal Psychology (now Sofia University) in 2014 with a Master's in Counseling Psychology and have been working with children, adolescents, adults, couples, and families since then. I often combine my Western training in psychology with over 10 years of experience in yoga, meditation, and altered states of consciousness.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition to my training in psychology, I have studied yoga, meditation with a number of teachers for the last decade and has been undergoing training with a Siberian shaman and healer for the last year. I am also currently enrolled in training at Process Therapy Institute where I continue learn and improve my psychotherapeutic skills.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have experience working with:</p>

                <br>
                <p>Prior to becoming a counselor, I worked in accounting and high-tech and experienced all the pressures of the corporate world first-hand. I am passionate about helping people who work in competitive and demanding environments to find their own voice and feel that they are ''good enough''.</p>
