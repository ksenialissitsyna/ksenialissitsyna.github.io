                <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
                <p>In my psychotherapy practice, I use the Process Model, developed by Don and Carol Hadlock. This model helps clients to become aware of and release constrictions that are blocking the natural life energy flow. When this flow is blocked, people experience negative emotions and a sense of dis-ease. Once the blocks are released and life energy flows easily, people experience a sense of well-being and ease in their lives.<a href="services.html" class="button"> Learn More...</a></p>

                <h2>Reiki</h2>
                <p>Reiki is described as a ‘’spiritually guided life force energy’’. It is a type of Ki or prana energy which is often mentioned in Eastern traditions. It helps to restore the natural energetic balance in the body and mind. Reiki can detect and clear energy blocks. Reiki can never do harm and always facilitates healing. The recipient usually experiences deep relaxation and overall sense of peace and well-being during the session.<a href="services.html" class="button"> Learn More...</a></p>

                <h2>Past Life Regression</h2>
                <p>Whether you are looking to heal an issue that doesn’t seem to come from your experience in this life or to experience an adventure into another dimension, past life regression is a safe and effective practice. In  I use guided
                 meditation and hypnosis techniques to guide you into a state of deep relaxation where it is possible to remember your past life. You are fully aware throughout the session and in full control of your psyche.<a href="services.html" class="button"> Learn More...</a></p>

                    <p>I am a Marriage and Family therapist registered intern (#81771) practicing under supervision of Don Hadlock, licensed MFT (license #15316) at Process Therapy Institute in Campbell.</p>
                    <p>I have graduated from Institute of Transpersonal Psychology (now Sofia University) in 2014 with a Master's in Counseling Psychology and have been working with children, adolescents, adults, couples, and families since then. I often combine my Western training in psychology with over 10 years of experience in yoga, meditation, and altered states of consciousness. In addition to my training in psychology, I have studied yoga, meditation with a number of teachers for the last decade and has been undergoing training with a Siberian shaman and healer for the last year. I am also currently enrolled in training at Process Therapy Institute where I continue learn and improve my psychotherapeutic skills.</p>
