                <p>Past life therapy is an opportunity for you to visit the source of the issue to release the past. Like therapy, it is remembering and re-experiencing which heals. And in accessing your Higher Self, your soul, you can connect with a peace and wisdom.<a href="services.html" class="button"> Learn More...</a></p>

                    <p>I believe that each one of us has already experienced wholeness within at some point of our lives. It could have been during our childhood days, or during moments of absorption in our favorite hobby, or while enjoying a sunset, or having a spiritual experience.</p> 
                    <p>Most of us experienced moments of joy, connection, and feeling “enough”, at 
                    the way of disconnection and boredom. Since wholeness is a state of being who you really are, when you are disconnected from this place, you forget your true nature. This forgetfulness leads you to confusion about what to do with your life and your career, jobs and relationships that don’t nurture you.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to help you reconnect to the sense of wholeness within you and help you remove the obstacles to that connection. I provide a supportive empathetic environment to explore what is blocking you to become your best self and fulfill your potential. I use an experiential and direct process-oriented approach focused on the present moment.</p>
