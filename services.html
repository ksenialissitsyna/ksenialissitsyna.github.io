                <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
                <img id="psychotherapy" src="images/therapy.jpeg" alt="girl reading">
                <p>In my psychotherapy practice, I use the Process Model, developed by Don and Carol Hadlock in 1980. This model helps clients to become aware of and release constrictions that are blocking the natural life energy flow. When this flow is blocked, people experience negative emotions and a sense of dis-ease. Once the blocks are released and life energy flows easily, people experience a sense of well-being and ease in their lives.</p>
                <p>Many techniques are integrated in this model and I customize what I do for each individual client. Some people really enjoy somatic, spiritual, and mindfulness techniques, and others prefer cognitive and behavioral approach with assignment and homework. I listen to what works for my clients and then adjust my approach to fit their personality. I use a variety of techniques such as expressive arts, imagery,   cognitive-behavioral interventions, mindfulness, and others. Since healing always happens in the present moment, I stay with experiential and direct process-oriented framework focused on the present moment. I provide a supportive empathetic environment where we can explore what prevents you from becoming your best self and fulfilling your potential.</p>
                <p>In my sessions, I love combining my Western counseling psychology training with an Eastern approach to mind-body connection. I am passionate about integrating traditional therapeutic methods such as cognitive and somatic interventions with subtle energy interventions such as Reiki. If it feels right to the client, I give them Reiki throughout the session which helps to move the energy that underlies difficult emotions or thought patterns.</p>
                <p>Loving our self is essential for one’s well-being and growth.  The journey of individual psychotherapy helps you understand your life story while teaching you to have self-awareness and self-acceptance. If needed, negative beliefs (such as ‘’I do not love myself’’) are replaced with positive ones (‘’I love myself”) during our session.</p>

                <h2>Reiki</h2>
                <img id="energywork" src="images/energywork.jpeg" alt="water and pebbles">
                <p>In Reiki session, a practitioner uses light touch (or places hands a few inches above client’s body) to allow Reiki to flow from the practitioner's hands to where it is needed in the recipient. Reiki can never do harm and always facilitates healing. The recipient usually experiences deep relaxation and overall sense of peace and well-being during the session.</p>
                <p>How does Reiki work in conjunction with Psychotherapy (Psychotherapeutic Reiki)?</p>
                <p>Richard Curtin defines Psychotherapeutic Reiki as “a technique that blends Eastern energy concepts and Western psychological perspectives. It is used to treat psychological, emotional and behavioral problems. This technique utilizes the Reiki energy, mindfulness practice, cognitive psychotherapy, and stress management.” (http://www.reiki.org/Healing/Leading_with_Reiki.html). During the session, both client and therapist work together towards exploring and treating the underlying issue that is at the root cause of a presenting problem. Because this approach combines energy work with psychology, it allows the client to go deeper than traditional talk therapy.</p>
                <p>Psychotherapeutic Reiki can help with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Releasing traumatic memories</li>
                    <li>Relaxation and stress management</li>
                    <li>Improving overall well-being</li>
                    <li>Depression and grief</li>
                    <li>Processing difficult emotions</li>
                    <li>Letting go of negative beliefs and replacing them with positive ones</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Past Life Regression</h2>
                <img id="pastlife" src="images/pastlife.jpg" alt="spidernet">
                <p>Whether you are looking to heal an issue that doesn’t seem to come from your experience in this life or to experience an adventure into another dimension, past life regression is a safe and effective practice.</p>
                <p>In a past life regression session I use guided meditation and hypnosis techniques to guide you into a state of deep relaxation where it is possible to remember your past life. You are fully aware throughout the session and in full control of your psyche. I find that 15-20 min of Reiki helps facilitating a deeper relaxation and easier transition into a past life experience so I offer it as a part of a session.</p>
                <p>Past Life Regression can help with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating more loving relationships</li>
                    <li>Releasing phobias</li>
                    <li>Developing an insight about your present life conditions</li>
                    <li>Resolving a traumatic past life experience</li>
                    <li>Developing your own intuition and connection to source</li>
                </ul>
