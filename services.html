                <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
                <img id="psychotherapy" src="images/therapy.jpeg" alt="girl reading">
                <p>Individual Psychotherapy supports us in identifying, creating, and understanding ourselves. Often, psychotherapy will integrate group or family therapy into treatment because of the level of validation, empathy, and sympathy that one experiences. Including one’s system (supports) in therapy will often allow the individual to sustain the improvements made while in therapy.</p>
                <p>Different stressors in our lives can cause us to feel stuck and it can interfere with work and our relationships. If you are feeling lost, trapped, or alone it’s time you find some relief. Some clients seek medication management treatment from their physicians. Medications can be supportive of some symptoms, however, used in combination with behavioral therapy results in more immediate relief for some clients.</p>
                <p>Loving our self is essential in being able to accept love from someone else. The journey of individual psychotherapy supports you in understanding your story and your identity while learning to have self-compassion and self-awareness.</p>

                <h2>Energy Work</h2>
                <img id="energywork" src="images/energywork.jpeg" alt="water and pebbles">
                <p>Each chakra represents an aspect of higher consciousness that is essential to a person’s life. As a system, the seven chakras integrate a person’s mind, body and spirit; and each has a physical, emotional, creative, and celestial component. At a basic level, a person’s emotional and physical health is directly dependent on well-functioning chakras.</p>
                <h3>Chakra Balancing:</h3>
                <p>Any distortion in a person’s chakra balancing can sooner or later negatively impact them physically. Likewise, if they make a correction to their chakra balancing, a corresponding change will be present in their body. It’s that simple. As above so below. Whenever we block an experience because it was unpleasant or emotional, we also block the corresponding positive emotion that we gain by a well-functioning chakra. It may get clogged with stagnant energy and spin irregularly or in the wrong direction. This can be easily remedied with the correct training or practice. My Energy Healing Modality is called Star Magic and you can learn everything that will set you on your own healing journey.</p>
                <p>When our chakras become distorted it usually means we are creating a reality that we believe to be valid, but in actuality is something we have indeed fabricated from our earlier experiences, past lives or genetic conditioning. These lies and the act of being dishonest with ourselves (unauthentic) can minimize us and take away our positive energy—the outcome, many times, can lead to diminished health. That’s because we send out a distorted vision of the world and the world gives us exactly what we’re projecting.</p>

                <h2>Past Life Regression</h2>
                <img id="pastlife" src="images/pastlife.jpg" alt="spidernet">
                <p>Past life therapy is an opportunity for you to visit the source of the issue to release the past. Like therapy, it is remembering and re-experiencing which heals. And in accessing your Higher Self, your soul, you can connect with a peace and wisdom.</p>
                <p>You don’t have to believe in reincarnation or karma for past life therapy.</p>
                <h3>What will a session look like:</h3>
                <p>You will be put in a deeply relaxed state using hypnotic regression, a deeper form of guided imagery, dreaming, or meditation. I will guide you into this state by talking to you while soothing music is played in the background. You will be guided to a very deep state of relaxation and peace. It is much like dreaming, where you see, hear, and feel while another part of you knows that you are in a dream.</p>
                <p>You are always in control for your psyche will never do anything you don’t want to do. Sometimes, it may not be necessary to go to a past life — a childhood memory might be enough.</p>       
                <h3>Past life therapy can:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heal troubling emotional, behavior, and relationship patterns that seem to have a life of their own, despite attempts to change</li>
                    <li>Alleviate grief, depression, and anxiety</li>
                    <li>Release phobias</li>
                    <li>Create more loving relationships</li>
                    <li>Offer insight which may shift your perspective about significant events in this lifetime</li>
                    <li>Deepen creativity and intuition</li>
                    <li>Experience and deepen the highest in yourself</li>
                    <li>Help you know your soul purpose</li>
                </ul>
